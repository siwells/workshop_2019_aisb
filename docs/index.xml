      <description>Download a PDF version of the first call for papers  We are pleased to invite submissions for our forthcoming Workshop on Intelligent Machines and Human Behaviour, to be held as part of the AISB 2019 Conference in Falmouth UK, 16th-18th April 2019. Artificially intelligent machines are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society and are likely to play an important, even ubiquitous, role in future everyday decision making. This is a trend that is likely to accelerate as new techniques for automated-reasoning and machine-learning are applied to decision making within real-world domains.</description>

      <description>Paper &amp;amp; Position-paper dates extended: 28th January 2019 (see the dates page for more details).
This workshop will run as part of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB 2019) annual convention.
Artificially intelligent machines are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society and are likely to play an important, even ubiquitous, role in future everyday decision making. This is a trend that is likely to accelerate as new techniques for automated-reasoning and machine- learning are applied to decision making within real-world domains.</description>

      <description>The workshop encourages submissions in two categories:
 Short Papers reporting on either completed work or work in progress (up to 6 pages including notes and references). Position statements offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 3 pages including notes and references).  Papers should be submitted using the AISB style. In order to aid the AISB organisers in producing a collection of accepted papers after the convention, if you use LaTeX please upload all sources and images in a single folder in addition to the PDF.</description>

      <description>Generally, we are interested in all aspects of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can, do, and perhaps will, either explicitly or implicitly, affect human behaviour.
Topics of interest to this meeting include, but are not limited to the following:
 Artificial Intelligence Behaviour Change &amp;amp; Management Captology Dark Patterns &amp;amp; Misuse Digital Persuasion Gamification Human Behaviour Real world applications of AI techniques Trust  </description>
