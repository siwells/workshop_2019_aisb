      <description>This workshop will run as part of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB 2019) annual convention.
Artificially intelligent machines are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society and are likely to play an important, even ubiquitous, role in future everyday decision making. This is a trend that is likely to accelerate as new techniques for automated-reasoning and machine- learning are applied to decision making within real-world domains.</description>

      <description>The workshop encourages submissions in two categories:
 Short Papers reporting on either completed work or work in progress (up to 6 pages including notes and references). Position statements offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 3 pages including notes and references).  Papers should be submitted using the AISB style.
Paper submission will be managed using the Easychair conference system.
Authors of papers accepted for presentation at IMHB will be invited to submit a revised version for publication in a post-workshop volume.</description>

      <description>Generally, we are interested in all aspects of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can, do, and perhaps will, either explicitly or implicitly, affect human behaviour.
Topics of interest to this meeting include, but are not limited to the following:
 Artificial Intelligence Behaviour Change &amp;amp; Management Captology Dark Patterns &amp;amp; Misuse Digital Persuasion Gamification Human Behaviour Real world applications of AI techniques Trust  </description>
