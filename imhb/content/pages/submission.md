The workshop encourages submissions in two categories:

* Standard Papers, reporting on either completed work or work in progress (up to 6 pages).
* Position statements offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 3 pages).

Papers should be submitted using the <a href="#">AISB style</a>.

Paper submission will be managed using the <a href="#">Easychair conference system</a>.

Authors of the long papers accepted for presentation at CMNA XV will be invited to submit a revised version for publication in a post-workshop volume, edited by Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series, collecting papers from all workshops at PRIMA 2015.
