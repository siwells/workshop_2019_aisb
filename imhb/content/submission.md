The workshop encourages submissions in two categories:

* Short Papers reporting on either completed work or work in progress (up to 6 pages including notes and references).
* Position statements offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 3 pages including notes and references).

Papers should be submitted using the [AISB style](http://aisb2019.falmouthgamesacademy.com/programme/submissions/).

Paper submission will be managed using the [Easychair conference system](#).

Authors of papers accepted for presentation at IMHB will be invited to submit a revised version for publication in a post-workshop volume.
