The workshop encourages submissions in two categories:

* Short Papers reporting on either completed work or work in progress (up to 6 pages including notes and references).
* Position statements offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 3 pages including notes and references).

Papers should be submitted using the [AISB style](http://aisb2019.falmouthgamesacademy.com/programme/submissions/). In order to aid the AISB organisers in producing a collection of accepted papers after the convention, if you use LaTeX please upload all sources and images in a single folder in addition to the PDF. Similarly, if you are using Word, please ensure to upload both the Word source file and a PDF.

Paper submission will be managed using the [Easychair conference system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=imhb2019).

Authors of papers accepted for presentation at IMHB will be invited to submit a revised version for publication in a post-workshop volume.
